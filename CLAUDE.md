## Behavioral guidelines
<!-- aia-harness:behavioral — non-negotiable; do not edit, reorder, or remove during enrichment -->

1. **Think before coding** — state assumptions explicitly; if multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of picking silently; say so when a simpler approach exists; if something is unclear, stop and ask.
2. **Simplicity first** — minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative features, no abstractions for single-use code, no unrequested configurability, no error handling for impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.
3. **Surgical changes** — touch only what the request requires; match existing style; don't refactor, reformat, or "improve" adjacent code. Remove orphans *your* change created; leave pre-existing dead code alone (mention it, don't delete it). Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.
4. **Goal-driven execution** — turn tasks into verifiable goals ("fix the bug" → "write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"). For multi-step work, state a brief plan with a verify check per step, then loop until verified.
5. **Main session = orchestrator — it does not implement.** Plan, decide, coordinate; ALL delegable implementation and analysis goes to a specialist subagent via `Agent`, parallel when scopes don't conflict.
6. **LINGUAGEM** MANTENHA O IDIOMA: Sempre comunique-se, explique suas ações e documente o projeto em Português do Brasil (pt-BR).

- _No canonical commands detected — fill these in._

## Workflow & Agents

Invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` for **non-trivial** implementation — trigger it when the request meets **≥2** of:

- touches **3+ files** or **2+ domains/layers** (UI + agent, API + DB…)
- is a **new feature / epic / cross-cutting refactor** (not a one-line or single-function change)
- needs a **multi-step plan** or ordered tasks, each with its own verification
- has **unclear scope or root cause** and needs exploration before coding

Skip it — implement inline — for typo/copy fixes, single-function edits, config tweaks, or one-file bugs with an obvious cause.

When dispatching subagents, you MUST use the matching specialist agent from the table below — never the generic agent when a specialist is listed. Cross-reference the task type with the "When to use" column and pass the exact name as `subagent_type`.

Model dispatch: an agent's frontmatter `model` wins; a generic dispatch or a project/user agent with no `model` in frontmatter is force-set to `sonnet` by a PreToolUse hook, so it never silently inherits this session's model — except namespaced plugin agents (`plugin:name`), left unrewritten since their frontmatter isn't reliably hook-resolvable. Pass `model` explicitly yourself for those, or to override for complex work: `haiku` for search/exploration, `sonnet` for implementation, `opus` for architectural judgment — cheapest tier that fits.

| Agent | When to use |
|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Coordinates multi-agent or cross-domain tasks by subdelegating to specialized agents. Use proactively when a task spans multiple domains or requires parallel subagent execution. MUST BE USED instead of dispatching generic agents directly for complex workflows. |
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews any code change for bugs, security, error handling, and test coverage. Use proactively after editing any source file. MUST BE USED before merging a pull request. |
| `security-reviewer` | Reviews code for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, broken auth, and dependency CVEs. Use proactively before any merge that touches auth, input handling, or secrets. MUST BE USED before shipping security-sensitive changes. |
| `qa-automation-engineer` | Writes and maintains E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) and CI/CD quality gates. Use proactively after new user flows are implemented or when E2E coverage is missing for a critical path. |
| `test-engineer` | Writes unit and integration tests with TDD discipline, coverage analysis, and edge-case discovery. Use proactively after implementing new logic or when test coverage gaps are identified. |
| `database-architect` | Designs schemas, migrations, indexes, and query strategies for correctness, integrity, and scalability. Use proactively when adding tables, modifying schemas, planning migrations, or diagnosing slow queries. |
| `devops-engineer` | Owns deployment, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure configuration, and production operations. Use proactively when deploying, configuring servers, setting up CI, or troubleshooting production incidents. |
| `performance-optimizer` | Profiles and fixes performance bottlenecks — slow endpoints, high memory usage, poor Core Web Vitals, and database query inefficiency. Use proactively after profiling reveals a bottleneck or when response times degrade. |
| `product-manager` | Clarifies ambiguous requirements and prioritizes roadmap decisions when requirements are undefined before a story exists. Use when discovery and prioritization need structured analysis. |
| `product-owner` | Translates business objectives into actionable technical specs and defines acceptance criteria for existing stories before implementation begins. Use when a story needs clear acceptance criteria before development starts. |
| `project-planner` | Breaks features and epics into ordered, executable tasks with clear acceptance criteria. Use proactively when starting a new feature, sprint, or significant refactor that needs a structured plan before implementation begins. |
| `code-archaeologist` | Reverse-engineers undocumented or legacy code to uncover intent, trace logic, and map hidden dependencies. Use proactively before refactoring unfamiliar legacy code or when you need to understand why existing behavior exists. |
| `debugger` | Finds the root cause of bugs, crashes, and flaky behavior through systematic, evidence-based investigation. Use proactively when a test fails or a defect is reported, before attempting a fix. |
| `explorer-agent` | Maps an unfamiliar or complex codebase — architecture, patterns, dependencies, and risk areas — to inform planning and integration decisions. Use proactively when onboarding to a new codebase or before planning a cross-cutting change. |
| `documentation-writer` | Produces clear, example-rich technical documentation — READMEs, API docs, runbooks, and guides. Use when documentation is explicitly requested or after a feature ships and needs user-facing docs. |
| `penetration-tester` | Simulates attacker techniques to find exploitable vulnerabilities using PTES and OWASP methodologies. Use proactively before a security release, after adding new auth flows, or when a pentest is required. |
| `security-auditor` | Performs defensive SAST reviews, threat modeling, and hardening recommendations using defense-in-depth principles. Use proactively before a major release or after architectural changes that touch auth, data handling, or trust boundaries. |

### Superpowers → Project Specialists (mandatory bridging)
<!-- aia-harness:agent-routing — superpowers→specialist bridge; do not remove -->

Superpowers skills (`superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`,
`superpowers:executing-plans`, `superpowers:systematic-debugging`) show `general-purpose` as the default
`subagent_type` in their examples. **Never dispatch `general-purpose` (or a generic
implementer) when a specialist below covers the domain** — pass the specialist's exact
name as `subagent_type` instead.

> Basis: superpowers itself states "User's explicit instructions (CLAUDE.md) — highest
> priority." This section applies that priority over the agent types its examples suggest.
> The normal flow is unchanged (`superpowers:brainstorming` → `superpowers:writing-plans` → `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`);
> only the dispatched `subagent_type` changes.

| When superpowers would use `general-purpose` for… | Dispatch instead |
|---|---|
| Multi-domain feature — subdelegates to specialists | `orchestrator` |
| Review / audit changed code | `code-reviewer` / `security-reviewer` |
| E2E / QA automation | `qa-automation-engineer` |
| Unit / integration tests | `test-engineer` |
| Schema / migration / query / data modeling | `database-architect` |
| Deploy / CI/CD / infra | `devops-engineer` |
| Performance profiling / optimization | `performance-optimizer` |
| Understand legacy code before changing it | `code-archaeologist` |
| Bug / crash / root-cause analysis | `debugger` |
| Explore / map an unfamiliar codebase | `explorer-agent` |
| Documentation (only when explicitly requested) | `documentation-writer` |
| Offensive security / pentest | `penetration-tester` |
| Security audit / defensive review | `security-auditor` |

### Parallel wave execution (subagent-driven-development)
<!-- aia-harness:parallel-sdd — parallel wave execution override; do not remove -->

Override `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`'s serial one-implementer-at-a-time default with
parallel waves of independent tasks. Its "never dispatch implementers in parallel" red flag is
superseded here because its two premises are removed: disjoint file ownership per wave, and
controller-serialized commits instead of implementer self-commits. During planning, tag each task
`Files:` / `Depends-on:`; batch tasks with disjoint `Files` and no mutual dependency into one wave,
and dispatch their implementers in a single message using the specialist types from the table above.
Keep the skill's implementer/reviewer prompt contracts intact — the only change is implementers do
NOT self-commit. Untagged or uncertain tasks run serial (no regression). Full protocol:
`.claude/rules/08-parallel-subagent-driven-development.md`.

## Architecture map

Domain-specific guidance lives in nested CLAUDE.md files (loaded on demand):

- No application code yet — only `requisitosBases/requisitos.md` (the requirements
  and business-rules spec for the Kanban sequencing system) and this `.claude/`
  harness exist. Planned stack per the spec: Python (FastAPI or Django) backend,
  React SPA frontend, PostgreSQL/SQL Server database. Read `requisitosBases/requisitos.md`
  in full before scaffolding either side.

## Conventions

- **Patan is a single letter, A–H** — programador submits exactly one; never treat it as a multi-char code (legacy docs suggested 8 chars, confirmed false for this system by the user — see `.claude/memory/business-rule-patan-format-unconfirmed.md`).
- **STATUS is a state machine, not a flag**: `2`=normal production (sequential numbering), `3`=critical/quarantine (`sequencia=0`, never steals normal numbering), `0`=excluded from planning, `9`=locked/batch ready to persist. Shift-header rows are visual-only — also `sequencia=0`, no start/end time.
- **Sequencing cascade ("escadinha")**: item `sequencia==1` starts at its shift's fixed time (1st 06:20, 2nd 14:40, 3rd 23:00); every later item's `Hora Inicial` must equal the *previous* item's `Hora Final` on the same posto de trabalho — never computed independently.
- **Lunch-break insertion**: if an item's production window crosses its shift's meal time, add +40min to that item's `Hora Final` once (later items inherit the delay for free via the escadinha rule above — don't add it again downstream). Meal times are **placeholders, user will hand-tune**: turno 1 10:20, turno 2 18:40, turno 3 03:00 (each = shift start + 4h). Whenever the +40min is applied, the item's card must visibly show `"HORARIO DE ALMOCO INCLUSO"` — operators need to see the duration includes the break.
- **Production time formula**: `(Kanbans × Qtd_por_Kanban) × Tempo_por_Peca`.
- **Staging vs. Produção split**: Tabela A (buffer, SAP dump, cleared after batch send) feeds the frontend's working set; Tabela B (Kanban oficial) is the immutable, persisted source for dashboards/history — never write history-facing code against Tabela A.
- **Scope every destructive/bulk DB op by (Patan, Linha, Turno)** — an unscoped delete/clear can wipe another operator's in-progress plan.
- **Frontend state stays in-memory**: sequence edits, reprioritization, and calc simulation happen client-side only; POST/PUT to the backend fires as a single bulk operation on explicit user submit, not per-edit.

## Engineering rules
<!-- aia-harness:fixed — non-negotiable; do not edit, reorder, or remove during enrichment -->

- Match the style of surrounding code; do not introduce new patterns unprompted.
- Test what can break — business rules, branching logic, money/security/auth, bug regressions; skip trivial getters, wrappers, config, presentational UI (rubric: `.claude/rules/05-testing.md`).
- Run the lint + test commands above before claiming work is complete.
- Never commit secrets; keep them in gitignored env files (`.env`/`.env.local`) — `.claude/settings.local.json` is only for MCP-server credentials referenced by `.mcp.json`.
- Fix every compilation/syntax/lint error found during a session — regardless of whether you edited the file. Never leave the build broken or label errors "pre-existing, not related".
- When performing a code review (user requests it or a workflow triggers it), always use `code-reviewer` and `security-reviewer`, applying the `uncle-bob-craft` skill's criteria (Dependency Rule, SOLID in context, code smells) alongside their findings.
